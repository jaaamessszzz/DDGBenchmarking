    "Talked with Kyle about the direction of my rotation so far and decided we should wait Colin's response before continuing with the DDG RosettaScript Protocol. The rationale is that my time will better spent working on something else instead of trying to implement the BackrubProtocol Mover in RosettaScripts on my own since Colin is going to help anyways.<br>\n",
